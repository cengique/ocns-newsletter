\noindent{}We received 42 responses on the Participant Feedback Survey distributed at the end of CNS*2024.
Overall, the feedback has been positive. The data is presented in \cref{fig:cns2024-summary} above, with 5 being the highest rating.

Most people have enjoyed the venue: 71\% gave 4 or 5 rating in this category (\cref{fig:cns2024-summary} A).
Attendees commented highly on the quality of the keynote speakers: 55\% gave the highest (5) rating in this category (\cref{fig:cns2024-summary} B).
The common theme was a commendation to the local organizers for catering, efficiency, and airport pickup; while the AV, staff English proficiency, and the small space allocated for posters received mostly negative comments.

Tutorials had mixed reviews: 10\% of the attendees submitted the rating less than average satisfaction (1 or 2), while most people, 42\%, gave the rating 4 (\cref{fig:cns2024-summary} C). No comments were provided.

The attendance at the workshops varied.
Some workshops received very high praise; 80\% of people gave ratings 4 or 5, with comments such as \enquote{very interesting topics}, \enquote{amazing}, \enquote{excellent session} (\cref{fig:cns2024-summary} D).
While other workshops left attendees dissatisfied, with suggestions to reduce the number of parallel sessions to boost the attendance.

Overall, 79\% attendees enjoyed oral presentations and gave the ratings 4 or 5, while 21\% rated the presentation as satisfactory (3) or below (2), \cref{fig:cns2024-summary} E.
Positive comments included \enquote{OCNS is superb in supporting young scientist's careers}.
Suggestions for improvements included more talks on data-driven, deep learning-based approaches.
We thank everybody for their feedback that will be taken into account when organizing CNS*2025.

\noindent{}{\color{Blue}\textbf{\large Note from the publisher, Springer Nature:\\}}

\noindent{}Each year, Journal of Computational Neuroscience publishes a supplement including abstracts from the CNS annual meeting.
In 2023, the CNS*22 abstracts supplement was published in January.
Changes in the supplement publishing process and our oversight in timely communicating the same to OCNS have regrettably delayed publication of the abstracts from CNS*23.
Proofs of this 2024 supplement are now being finalized.
Please accept our sincere apologies for the delay.
Springer Nature values the relationship between the Organization for Computational Neurosciences and Journal of Computational Neuroscience.
We look forward to the timely publication of future CNS supplements.
