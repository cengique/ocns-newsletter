Many thanks to Axel Hutt (Deputy Chair), Sang Wan Lee, Ian Stevenson and Nassi Papoutsi for their service on the Program Committee, and extend a warm welcome to Andre Peterson, Masanori Shimono, Yunliang Zang and Arezoo Alizadeh.
We're currently working on selecting keynotes for CNS*2025 Florence, and look forward to a robust round of abstract reviewing in spring.

We received 42 responses on the Participant Feedback Survey distributed at the end of CNS*2024.
Overall, the feedback has been positive. The data is presented in \cref{fig:cns2024-summary} above, with 5 being the highest rating.

Most people have enjoyed the venue: 71\% gave 4 or 5 rating in this category (\cref{fig:cns2024-summary} A).
Attendees commented highly on the quality of the keynote speakers: 55\% gave the highest (5) rating in this category (\cref{fig:cns2024-summary} B).
The common theme was a commendation to the local organizers for catering, efficiency, and airport pickup; while the AV, staff English proficiency, and the small space allocated for posters received mostly negative comments.

Tutorials had mixed reviews: 10\% of the attendees submitted the rating less than average satisfaction (1 or 2), while most people, 42\%, gave the rating 4 (\cref{fig:cns2024-summary} C). No comments were provided.

The attendance at the workshops varied.
Some workshops received very high praise; 80\% of people gave ratings 4 or 5, with comments such as \enquote{very interesting topics}, \enquote{amazing}, \enquote{excellent session} (\cref{fig:cns2024-summary} D).
While other workshops left attendees dissatisfied, with suggestions to reduce the number of parallel sessions to boost the attendance.

Overall, 79\% attendees enjoyed oral presentations and gave the ratings 4 or 5, while 21\% rated the presentation as satisfactory (3) or below (2), \cref{fig:cns2024-summary} E.
Positive comments included \enquote{OCNS is superb in supporting young scientist's careers}.
Suggestions for improvements included more talks on data-driven, deep learning-based approaches.
We thank everybody for their feedback that will be taken into account when organizing CNS*2025.

\begin{wrapfigure}{l}[0pt]{0.2\textwidth}

Each year, Journal of Computational Neuroscience publishes a supplement including abstracts from the CNS annual meeting.
In 2023, the CNS*2022 abstracts supplement was published in January.
Changes in the supplement publishing process and our oversight in timely communicating the same to OCNS have regrettably delayed publication of the abstracts from CNS*2023.
Proofs of this 2024 supplement are now being finalized.
Please accept our sincere apologies for the delay.
Springer Nature values the relationship between the Organization for Computational Neurosciences and Journal of Computational Neuroscience.
We look forward to the timely publication of future CNS supplements.

\end{wrapfigure}

The Software Working Group aims to increase awareness and knowledge of the various software tools that we use to carry out our research.
The group is an open community group that everyone is welcome to join.
It is shared between the OCNS and the \href{https://incf.org}{International Neuroinformatics Co-ordinating Facility (INCF)}, of which OCNS is a member organization.

In the past year, the group has continued to host sessions on different neuroscience software.
Recordings from these sessions can be found on the \href{https://www.youtube.com/@IncfOrg_INCF/videos}{INCF YouTube channel}, and also on the \href{https://training.incf.org/course/incfocns-working-group-computational-neuroscience-software}{INCF Training Space}.
Working group announcements are published on our \href{https://ocns.github.io/SoftwareWG/}{website}.

If there are software tools/standards that you think are useful for the community to know and learn about, please contact either of the working group co-chairs to let us know (\href{mailto:marcel.stimberg@sorbonne-universite.fr}{marcel.stimberg@sorbonne-universite.fr}, \href{mailto:ankur.sinha@ucl.ac.uk}{ankur.sinha@ucl.ac.uk}).
We will reach out to the developers of the software to organize a session on it.

The working group also sets up task forces to work on specific projects.
Currently, a task force is working on developing a simple web based tool to help community members decide what simulation tool they should use.
A working title for this tool is \href{https://github.com/OCNS/simselect/issues}{Simselect}. 
If you would like to get involved in this task force, please let us know.

OCNS is currently working on a mentorship scheme for members.
The scheme aims to provide support to members to develop their research careers further to move to the next level of their professional development.
It aims to provide the space for our researchers to be supported and through this to identify areas that we could develop to be able to support our community more.

More details on the OCNS mentoring scheme will be announced shortly.
Please do keep an eye out for related communications and please do get in touch (\href{mailto:eirini.mavritsaki@bcu.ac.uk}{eirini.mavritsaki@bcu.ac.uk}) if you would like to help in its organization.
