\noindent{}We received 42 responses on the Participant Feedback Survey distributed at the end of CNS*2024.
Overall, the feedback has been positive. The data is presented in \cref{fig:cns2024-summary} above, with 5 being the highest rating.

Most people have enjoyed the venue: 71\% gave 4 or 5 rating in this category (\cref{fig:cns2024-summary} A).
Attendees commented highly on the quality of the keynote speakers: 55\% gave the highest (5) rating in this category (\cref{fig:cns2024-summary} B).
The common theme was a commendation to the local organizers for catering, efficiency, and airport pickup; while the AV, staff English proficiency, and the small space allocated for posters received mostly negative comments.

Tutorials had mixed reviews: 10\% of the attendees submitted the rating less than average satisfaction (1 or 2), while most people, 42\%, gave the rating 4 (\cref{fig:cns2024-summary} C). No comments were provided.

The attendance at the workshops varied.
Some workshops received very high praise; 80\% of people gave ratings 4 or 5, with comments such as \enquote{very interesting topics}, \enquote{amazing}, \enquote{excellent session} (\cref{fig:cns2024-summary} D).
While other workshops left attendees dissatisfied, with suggestions to reduce the number of parallel sessions to boost the attendance.

Overall, 79\% attendees enjoyed oral presentations and gave the ratings 4 or 5, while 21\% rated the presentation as satisfactory (3) or below (2), \cref{fig:cns2024-summary} E.
Positive comments included \enquote{OCNS is superb in supporting young scientist's careers}.
Suggestions for improvements included more talks on data-driven, deep learning-based approaches.
We thank everybody for their feedback that will be taken into account when organizing CNS*2025.
