\noindent{}A limited number of merit based travel awards, given based on review of summaries by the program committee, are available to presenting students and postdocs who are OCNS members. Women and members of other historically marginalized communities in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics are particularly encouraged to apply.
Applications for travel grants are to be submitted during the abstract submission process at the annual OCNS conference.

This year's travel awards were competitive, with many more excellent applicants than available funds.
We were pleased to award 19 travel grants to participants from all over the world:
